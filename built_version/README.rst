The built_version
------------------

The project was made on printed circuit board ( all files are included in Kicad folder )

This version does not use the PNK,

And the 6S19P's CCS is decoupled and has zener protection that prevents slippage cathode voltage on the higer swing

Power is succinct and yet respects the constants time

Local feedback of -1 dB, improve the damping factor
