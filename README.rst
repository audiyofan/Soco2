Presentation
------------

Soco2 is a valve push-pull type amplifier delivering 10W in 8ohms with a low output impedance. It uses cheap Russian 6C19Π low impedance triodes as output valve and can be used without global feedback.

Warning
-------

This schematic implies the use of **lethal voltages**. Maximum precautions must be observed when working with this kind of high voltages. Authors are **not** responsible in any way for any problems, damages or injuries that would result in the making of the work and / or use of this schematic (see LICENCE file).

Results
-------

Realisations emitted very natural, detailed and transparent sound with nice deep bass using speakers as low as 90dB/W/m. Measures showed -74dB THD for 1/2W output and -65dB THD for 1W (H2 and H3) with matched tubes. Output can reach 13W with -40dB THD in 8Ω.
